## Background and Movivation:

As computer science education continues to gain traction in K-12, more students are outgrowing the constraints of block-based learning platforms like Scratch. Unfortuantely, learning platforms for JavaScript rarely suit the needs of schools - most are either to rigidly structured or self-paced to suit a classroom setting, and those few that are geared towards classroom environments charge more per student annually than most public schools can afford. 

The ultimate goal of this project is to create an open-source JavaScript learning platform that combines some of the classroom and assignment features of Google Classroom with a browser-based IDE in which students can learn to code using standard JavaScript, or a modified, beginner-friendly version focused on visual feedback for earlier learners. 

Educators will be empowered to define the scope of their own assignments and projects and design their own curriculum, while also having access to our own course outlines and a "cookbook" of different projects to choose from to support their growth as computer science educators.

## Coming Soon:
- Google OAuth support
- Class rosters
- Multi-class support for teachers
- Improved assignment editing
- JavaScript playground assignment integration
- "Beginner" mode for visual coding with cooridnate plane

## Current Tech Stack:
- React
- Node
- Express
- PostgreSQL
- MongoDB
